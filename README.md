# coc-project-calculator
A simple calculator program in C that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus using if-else statements. It demonstrates basic input/output, functions, and conditional logic in C programming.
This project is a simple calculator program written in C language. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
The program takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user, processes the operation using if-else statements, and displays the result.

The project demonstrates the use of:

Basic input/output in C (scanf, printf)

Conditional statements (if, else if, else)

Functions for modular programming

Arithmetic operators and logical flow control

Clean and well-commented code for readability


This calculator is a beginner-friendly C project that helps understand decision-making, functions, and operator handling in C programming.
